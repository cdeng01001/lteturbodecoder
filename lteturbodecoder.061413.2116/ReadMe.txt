A little messy.  I'm going on vacation so this is hurry-up effort.  

run the demo package with:


java -jar lteturbodemo_allin1.jar -f lte.cfg


Use the BCJR and turbo decoding lib with the

LTEturboDecoder.jar


I use Netbeans so I tested it using Add Jar in netbeans.  The random generators are from uncommons, please include that jar too.
